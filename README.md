# LesYeux
This is my final project where I have learned with DevAny many new tools. The course is mainly HTML, mixed with CSS styles. Within the project I used technologies such as Flaticon, Bootstrap 5.0 where I was able to include a web page base using navbars, cardboards, footers, responsive web design.
My main idea was to create innovation within a website using a green color palette, large fonts and looking to adapt it to different digital devices.
